# Content

Yes, all of the other stuff is important but the actual content of an offsite is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Without goals and anticipated outcomes, offsites may not maximize for the time you have together. This is the case whether your team iis co-located or distributed. You have a finite amount of time to be away from the office, away from your desk, and away from your day-to-day. Use it strategically anf thoughtfully.

### Goals
Start with the goal. Why is everyone getting together? What is the purpose? What are the items or tasks you and the team wishes to tackle together?

There are a variety of ways of getting to this goal. You may have something iin mind already. You can also survey your folks and ask them what success would mean for them? Incorporating these ideas in to both the goals as well as the rest of the agenda set for the offsite.

Every session should have a goal that contributes to your ultimate goal. It doesn't need to be groundbreaking or earth-shattering, but it should keep the session focused and on track. Additionally, people do better when they know what's expected of them. If a session has a goal, then folks will have a sense of what to include in the discussion versus what may be a tangent. Finally, if you find that the conversation is going off track, having a goal is a helpful and constructive way to refocus the conversation without making anyone feel "bad" or "wrong" for the points they are bringing up.

### Deliverables
Deliverables are tangible items that you will walk out of the offsite with. They don't have to be polished documents, but maybe they are. They could be your team's vision and mission. They could be a working agreement or contract you're making to other teams in your company. A deliverable could also be a plan or an outline for work that will be completed or continued after the offsite.

Every session does not need a deliverable, but if there are particular sessions you or another facilitator knows here is a desired deliverable then note that on the agenda and make it clear to the group from the start.

### Session Leaders
While it might be tempting for some of you to lead all the sessions yourself... don't. An offsite is a pretty intense experience. It's a lot of time, usually in a single room, for multiple days. Mix it up! Lead some sessions yourself and empower teammates to facilitate, plan, and/or lead other sessions. There are three primary benefits here. First, this takes some of the stress off of you to be able to participate in certain sessions as opposed to always having the leader or facilitator role which sends an important signal to the team that not only do you manage them, but you are also a part of the team. Second, it lets people hear different tones and styles and experience different approaches. Finally, this can be a great growth and learning opportunity for team members who are looking to grow professionally and advance these sorts of skills which can be incredibly important in a role as a teammate, tech lead, or manager.

### Facilitation formats
I hesitate to call this a section in this overall content document because there are literally hundreds of formats you can use in order to facilitate effective, engaging conversations but I'll briefly dive in to a few options here as well as how to think about facilitation formats.
