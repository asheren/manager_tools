# Content

Yes, all of the other stuff is important but the actual content of an offsite is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Without goals and anticipated outcomes, offsites may not maximize for the time you have together. This is the case whether your team iis co-located or distributed. You have a finite amount of time to be away from the office, away from your desk, and away from your day-to-day. Use it strategically anf thoughtfully.

### Goals
Start with the goal. Why is everyone getting together? What is the purpose? What are the items or tasks you and the team wishes to tackle together?

There are a varieyt of ways of getting to this goal. You may have something iin mind already. You can also survey your folks and ask them what success would mean for them? Incorporating these ideas in to both the goals as well as the rest of the agenda set for the offsite.

Every session should have a goal that contributes to your utimate goal. It doesn' tnee dto be groundbreaking or earthshattering, but it should keep the session focused and on track. Additionally, people do better when they know what's expected of them. If a session has a goal, then folks will have a sense of what to include in the discussion versus what may be a tangent. Finally, if you find that the conversation is going off track, having a goal is a helpful and constructive way to refocus the conversation without making anyone feel "bad" or "wrong" for the points they are bringing up.
