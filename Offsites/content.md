# Content

Yes, all of the other stuff is important but the actual content of an offsite is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Without goals and anticipated outcomes, offsites may not maximize for the time you have together. This is the case whether your team iis co-located or distributed. You have a finite amount of time to be away from the office, away from your desk, and away from your day-to-day. Use it strategically anf thoughtfully.

### Goals
Start with the goal. Why is everyone getting together? What is the purpose? What are the items or tasks you and the team wishes to tackle together?

There are a variety of ways of getting to this goal. You may have something iin mind already. You can also survey your folks and ask them what success would mean for them? Incorporating these ideas in to both the goals as well as the rest of the agenda set for the offsite.

Every session should have a goal that contributes to your ultimate goal. It doesn't need to be groundbreaking or earth-shattering, but it should keep the session focused and on track. Additionally, people do better when they know what's expected of them. If a session has a goal, then folks will have a sense of what to include in the discussion versus what may be a tangent. Finally, if you find that the conversation is going off track, having a goal is a helpful and constructive way to refocus the conversation without making anyone feel "bad" or "wrong" for the points they are bringing up.

### Deliverables
Deliverables are tangible items that you will walk out of the offsite with. They don't have to be polished documents, but maybe they are. They could be your team's vision and mission. They could be a working agreement or contract you're making to other teams in your company. A deliverable could also be a plan or an outline for work that will be completed or continued after the offsite.

Every session does not need a deliverable, but if there are particular sessions you or another facilitator knows here is a desired deliverable then note that on the agenda and make it clear to the group from the start.

### Session Leaders
While it might be tempting for some of you to lead all the sessions yourself... don't. An offsite is a pretty intense experience. It's a lot of time, usually in a single room, for multiple days. Mix it up! Lead some sessions yourself and empower teammates to facilitate, plan, and/or lead other sessions. There are three primary benefits here. First, this takes some of the stress off of you to be able to participate in certain sessions as opposed to always having the leader or facilitator role which sends an important signal to the team that not only do you manage them, but you are also a part of the team. Second, it lets people hear different tones and styles and experience different approaches. Finally, this can be a great growth and learning opportunity for team members who are looking to grow professionally and advance these sorts of skills which can be incredibly important in a role as a teammate, tech lead, or manager.

### Facilitation Formats
I hesitate to call this a section in this overall content document because there are literally hundreds of formats you can use in order to facilitate effective, engaging conversations but I'll briefly dive in to a few options here as well as how to think about facilitation formats.

Think about session formats as a vehicle for facilitating the overall flow of your day's agenda. Often, individuals cannot sit for multiple hours or long periods of time without mixing it up a bit. A day should balance more frontal sessions, interactive sessions, and different timing options. 

One common format is a brainstorm. Brainstorms often include some individual post-it implementation, small group discussions, and large group conversations. Oftentimes brainstorms go hand-in-hand with facilitated conversations. If you're brainstorming a lot of ideas and then reviewing each one or talking about a larger topic, it is helpful to write out a framework, or questions that should be discussed for each idea. In a facilitated conversation, you can also establish ground rules around how frequently individuals speak or for how long. Other than a brainstorm, one example of a facilitated conversation is establishing a [group contract]().

Another common format is to include lightning talks. Lightning talks are short (5 minute or less) talks about a topic. This can be something the whole group needs to learn or it can be a great way to showcase something one individual is passionate about that they would like to share with others. Lightning talks are a great way to break up the day and encourage participation from others as well.

Finally, offsites often include some sort of learning session where you are interactively learning about a topic. These sessions should be engaging and interactive. Examples include learning about design thinking, or how to develop user personas.

### Facilitation 101
Facilitation is an art and a skill. It often does not come naturally, but that's ok. As you do more offsites (or even run more meetings), facilitation will become easier. Here are a few 101 tips:
- Make space for silence. Silence is awkward and uncomfortable for some and for others it is absolutely necessary to allow them to participate. Make time for silence and give it just a little more time than you're comfortable with. Often, I silently, slowly count to 5 from the time I feel uncomfortable to push it just a little further.
- Specifically make space for introverts. You can do this by saying something like "let's hear from anyone who hasn't spoken yet" or "does anyone who hasn't spoken yet want to add anything?"
- Mix it up. For some questions you may want people to answer freely. Something different you could do is to say for this question, you're going to go around the circle.
- Ask open-ended questions. A closed question is one that can be answered with a yes or a no and often if you ask a closed question, you'll get a closed answer. Work on rephrasing these. For example, instead of asking "Did you have a good day?", you could ask "What was one thing that made your day good or not so good today?"

### Prep work
Prep work is 100% optional! It depends on how often your team gets together and what the goals are for your offsite, but prep work can play an important role in ensuring your offsite goals are accomplished. Prep work can be as minimal or intense as you think your team would like. Prep work could be voting in advance on specific ideas or topics in order to narrow down what will be discussed at sessions. Prep work may include a bit of brainstorming in advance or coming prepared to discuss a topic. Prep work could also include reading materials in advance, although I highly recommend giving a brief summary of the reading in-person just in case everyone didn't have a chance to complete the reading.

As the offsite organizer, you have some prep work too. Your responsibility is to clearly outline any prep work or expectations for individuals attending the offsite, as well as circulating the agenda in advance so folks can review it if they choose to.

### Agenda Flow
Picturing your agenda from start to end is critical. How will people move? What do people need? When will they need breaks? How will they stay engaged? WHat special needs, if any, do you have on your team that you need to accommodate (more on this in the logistics section)?

Your agenda should have a healthy mix of deep dives, open discussion, quiet time, reflection, appreciation, small group work, and larger group work. It is important to try to get everyone in _the zone_ as much as possible but people are _people_. They need breaks, they need thoughtful engagement, and their brains, at some point, turn to mush and it's important to not burn them out or try to push them past that point. Trying to force people to make decisions or have critical conversations when they just want the day to be over or just can't engage any further is only going to lead to decisions or conversations that need to be revisited and revised in the future.

Depending on the size of  your offsite, your flow could be more or less formalized. For example, if an entire department is getting together or multiple teams, it may be helpful to focus days on different groups of people. The first day could be company and company priorities, the second day department, the third day team, and the final day personal/professional development and skills building. If the gathering is a team one, you can group the days by themes like coming together, solving issues, and moving forward as a three-day offsite.

### Bonding 
One of the most important aspects of an offsite is bonding!! Especially if you work at a remote or distributed company, periodically getting together is critical. Bonding can also help the rest of your agenda. You can do a bonding activity at the beginning to kick things off and create a closer experience for the rest of the offsite. You can schedule it for the middle, especially if your activity helps people deeply get to know one another or provides new perspectives. Finally, you can do it at the end to celebrate what the team has accomplished and use it as an opportunity to bring the offsite to a close.

There are a wide variety of kinds of bonding. What you end up doing will depend on your group. Think about the group dynamic, how long folks have known each other, what sorts of things they enjoy and don't enjoy, and, if people are traveling, if they would need any specific clothes or attire and whether or not that may be difficult to pack. Some options include volunteer, sporting events, a cooking class, some interesting or unique active activity, or a problem the team solves together. Bonding activities or outings do not need to be expensive or extravagant. It's about tapping in to something that will bring your team together.

How do you find these options for experiences? I've had luck using a few targeted approaches. First, finding a local to get tips from. You can ask the hotel concierge or see if you know someone in the area. Second, searching for "interesting things to do in CITY" which often times returns a list, some of which you can dig in to as options. Third, use various experience services especially peer to peer platforms like AirBnB and others to search for unique and cost effective options. Whatever you choose, make sure to do your due diligence and let your team know what to expect so they are prepared. Bonding experiences can be fun for some, but extremely anxiety-inducing for others.

### Unstructured Time
Equally important as what is planned is what isn't planned. Especially in distributed teams, simply having the time together as a team is an outcome all on it's own. When people interact with one another as people and get to know their colleagues beyond their slack handle, it creates more effective work environments and better communication that persists for months. Unstructured time can also be scary for a lot of people. It is easy for someone to feel like unstructured time is just time for them to sit in a foreign city alone. For some introverts who need the time to recharge, this is great! For others, it makes them feel unsure and lonely. 

There are many ways to think about unstructured time. First, providing breaks. You can (and should) provide periodic breaks during the day. In addition, it is often nice to provide a longer break at the end of the day before any evening plans. This gives everyone a chance to freshen up, rest, and recharge. Second is enabling connections. For larger groups, this can be done through table topics so that people can sit with others who have similar interests. For groups of any size, a section of a whiteboard, piece of paper, or online doc can be designated as a place where people can write about things they'd like to talk about and others can reach out to that person or put their names down as well, making an introduction or connection much easier to make. Finally, you can leave unstructured time and space with the goal of making it structured. Similar to what an unconference might look like, there are often topics, ideas, or discussions that come up at an offsite or just before. Leaving open time and space allows the group to vote on or suggest what that time should look like to ensure that their needs are being met and that they have ownership over a part of the agenda.

### Sample Agendas  
We've talked a lot about different components of agendas or what offsite agendas could look like. Check out some [sample offsite agendas](/agendas). And if you have an offsite agenda you'd like to share, PRs are welcome!

### Establishing a team contract
One of the ways I prefer to kick off offsites is by coming up with a team contract. A team contract helps set the stage for what the team should expect from one another. It lets the people in the room decide what the rules and expectations are for the offsite. By coming up with it as a group, you're able to create a set of expectations that everyone is bought in to and that you can refer back to if things deviate from a positive, productive environment. Oftentimes there are suggestions about respect, timeliness, participation, and more. The activity usually takes around 30 minutes and having 5-10 items is a good place to land. Hang up this team contract in a visible place in the room so that folks are regularly reminded of the expectations they have set for themselves and their peers. Some of my favorites are to have a rotating note taker and to be as tech-free as possible (phones down, computers closed, etc.).

### The Hack Time Special
Hack time agendas are a little different that a normal offsite so I wanted to touch on how these agendas may be a little different. Hackweeks are focused more around _doing_ and _producing_ in addition to thoughtful producing. For hackweeks or hack sessions, there is much less structured time and very few sessions since the goal is to get and keep everyone in the flow as much as possible. In addition to schedule changes, hackweeks often have more expectations around deliverables or what tangible pieces will come out of the hack week time.

If you're looking to incorporate hack time in to an offsite, it could  happen in a few ways. You could have a full hackweek, where folks are really heads down, working together, building, and solving issues for the whole time. In this case, projects should be decided upon in advance and every day shoould incorporate some sort of show and tell. OR you can do a 1-day "createathon". A createathon is like a hackweek but what is produced does not necessarily have to be code. For createathons, oor even single day hackdays, the expectations of what will be produced is lower and therefore you can break in to teams and come up with ideas when already at your offsite, as long as folks know to do some thinking in advance.

### Now you have all the pieces of the puzzle. Good luck creating a meaningful, engaging, positive in-person experience.

## You got this!!
