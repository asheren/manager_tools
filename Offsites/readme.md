# Offsite Readme

Whether your team is distributed or colocated, offsites accomplish important goals. Offsites give yourself and the people you bring together a chance to focus on specific problems for an extended period of time. These gatherings get everyone on the same page by getting them in the same room for both work and getting to know each other as people.

The goals of your offsite will be different depending on the goal and the audience. You can learn about different types of offsite [here](). 

Offsites can be a big undertaking, especially when a team operates remotely. There are lots of details to think through in crafting a unique and valuable in person experience but I can also tell you that if you put the work in to thinking through time together it is worth it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
