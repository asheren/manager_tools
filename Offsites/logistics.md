# Logistics 

Logistics may seem like dull, boring details but the atmosphere you set up for an offsite can have a huge impact on the general flow and vibe of your time together. For example, it is difficult to be in one room for multiple days. Some questions to ask yourself are... does the room have windows? Are there different places to have discussions and breakouts if you want to do larger group discussions vs. paired discussions? Are you eating in the room as well? Can everyone easily see the whiteboard space or space you'll be working from? Can the room accommodate any special needs your group has?

### Location
The location of an offsite is a critical detail and probably one of the most difficult decisions. When looking at a distributed team, it may be attractive to hold an offsite where the most people are located, but if you have flexibility it's worthwhile to think about travel hardships, are some team members always traveling and others never traveling, and what sort of environment do you want to have? Taking everyone out of their day-to-day is often helpful for focused, multi-day offsites. If the goal of your offsite is focused around executing work and hacking, you may want to hold your offsite somewhere closer to nature where the surrounding area isn't as distracting but offers quality areas to walk around in order to enable walking brainstorms around problem solving. Or, if it isn't too distracting, you may decide to utilize your office space for a gathering (although this is my least recommended option). Finally, think about the location in terms of team member preparation. To use a US-based example, if most of your team is located in southern Florida, you may not want to hold an offsite in the middle of Minnesota in January because it's possible most of your team will not have the adequate "gear" required to make it a pleasant experience.

When choosing a location, think of yourself and your team there. Your surroundings can have a large impact on not just physically, but also mentally bringing your team to another space.

### Accommodations
I know, I know, AirBnB or Vrbo-type sites can be attractive for gatherings. They're cheaper, you can save on rooming as well as meal costs by buying groceries and cooking, it seems very attractive. And this is a great option for _some teams_ and _some situations_ but there is A LOT to consider before going down this route.

First, do all the rooms have separate bathrooms, separate bedrooms, and locks on the doors.
Second, is the space accessible? Third, if you're planning on cooking meals, how will you ensure that this job does not fall to teh underrepresented minorities in the group, especially the women who often end up bearing the brunt of cooking or cleaning tasks when this sort of arrangement is in the plan. Third, is the space accessible for any  accessibility concerns or needs you may have? Fourth, are there any serious allergies among the group to be aware of?

If you can answer all of these questions, than an AirBnb may be a fine direction to go in for an offsite, but if not, a hotel room block is the way to go.

You may read over this list and think, well, this really only affects one person so we'll get an AirBnB for everyone and then this one person will stay at a hotel which will be a better situation for them. My question to you is, will it be a better situation for them? Having a single individual stay at a different location primarily because of their "singleness" in any specific category has the high likelihood of making that individual feel alienated or like they are not _really_ a part of the team. On the same note, if there is one person that you think may not feel comfortable with something, do not ask them. In all likelihood they will either will away their concerns or say they have no problem staying elsewhere simply because they don't want to cause a problem or throw a wrench in to the planning of an offsite. Do not put people in this situation. Be proactive and make sure that appropriate accommodations are secured.

### When
People are BUSY! Especially when you add in family members or previous commitments, and even more so when folks need to travel for the offsite. Sometimes figuring out _when_ everyone can meet is half the battle. The more people involved, the more difficult it becomes. My favorite way to pick a week is to create a spreadsheet. In Column A, you put each individuals name. In Column B, you can put where they are traveling from. The remaining columns, in Row B, put one week per column. In Row A, put the "key". Have each person fill in their row with a color. Red means "this week is absolutely no good for me". Yellow means "this week could work but it's difficult". Yellows often include a comment inside like "location dependent" or "I can only be available Tuesday and Wednesday". And Green means "This week is good for me". The spreadsheet gives you an easy place to keep a count of how many people are attending and gives a clear color-coded idea of which dates work.

One last recommendation is to try to plan at least 6 week in advance if possible because people need time to organize their lives accordingly. 

### Pre-Work
Besides content-related pre-work to complete, there is a fair bit of logistical pre-work required as well. The more people know about what to expect the more comfortable they will be. The more that people know the needs will be acknowledged and taken care of, the more present they can be. Here are a few helpful items for people to either fill out in forms or enter somewhere:
- Allergy information and dietary needs
- Activity preferences
- Accessibility concerns or accommodations needed
- Any other considerations needed (for example, pumping breastmilk, childcare, etc.)
- Transit information (when people are arriving/departing and to/from which airport) to help facilitate rideshares

Keep in mind that you always want to provide individuals with a confidential way to raise concerns or needs for accommodations that they may not want public.

### Special Requests
Whether you are new to your team or think you know everyone really well, asking for and accommodating special requests is really important. This may mean schedule adjustments, service needs, space requirements, or a variety of other things. Be sure to get a handle of these potential requests before booking any room block or deciding on accommodations for everyone, just in case the hotel or location cannot accommodate someone's needs.

### Know Your Folks
As I've already mentioned a number of times throughout this logistics document, offsites can be stressful for folks. Even when a team works in an offsite together on a daily basis, an offsite is different. It is often in a different location, you are spending a different amount of time with one another, and if the team is distributed, it means an entirely different kind of week for the individuals. Some people are fine with these changes. They can simply adjust to wherever they are, enjoy the change, and move forward. For others, it isn't as easy. A fair number of engineers are extroverts and spending multiple hours, multiple days in a row with people (especially other extroverts on the team) can be exhausting. Individuals may have a fear of flying, be concerned about leaving a partner solo for a week, they may have social anxiety, or they may just really dislike traveling.

These issues often pop up at random times and often someone doesn't simply say "I have social anxiety and i'm having a hard time right now." As an offsite leader, it is important to be as aware of these things as possible. I know in the past I have made the mistake of downplaying someone's concerns in an attempt to simply move forward and get the individual in to the flow of the offsite. One thing that may be helpful is asking how to best accommodate them. Are there special arrangements that can be made? Can you offer the individual an adjusted schedule or try to build a schedule that takes their needs in to account?  What can you do to support them and allay their fears or concerns?

### Alcohol
Alcohol. What good offsite planning manual can leave out this topic?! It's controversial, it's different for every team, and it's often pointed to as a helpful aspect of offsites.

Alcohol as a part of any activity is up to your team. What I will say about alcohol (as a mom of 2) is that there are a variety of reasons why individuals can't or don't drink. Maybe they are on medication, maybe they are pregnant (and either talking OR not talking about it yet) or nursing and choosing not to partake, maybe it isn't their thing, maybe they have history with addiction. When planning, think of a variety of options so that someone who isn't drinking doesn't feel like it is the **only** bonding activity or the **core** part of the activity. and please, have a good code of conduct and escalation policy in place.

### Don't Forget
Team gatherings can be a great time to celebrate other life events! Don't forget about things like birthdays, work anniversaries, births, engagements, marriages, transitions, etc. happening during or around the offsite.

### Materials Needed
In the chaotic midst of all of this planning, it can be difficult to ensure you have all the materials you need. Sure, you may remember post-it notes or dry-erase markers, but what about scotch tape? or painter's tape? Pens? Scratch paper? And all the other little things. For each session and for the offsite as a whole, make a note of what materials are needed so you can order them a week before the offsite. Additionally, if you're likely to have leftover supplies, work with the hotel or any local individuals on your team (or those at the company) to see if whatever remains can be donated to a local school or program for children when the offsite is done.
