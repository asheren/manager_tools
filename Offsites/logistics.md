# Logistics 

Logistics may seem like dull, boring details but the atmosphere you set up for an offsite can have a huge impact on the general flow and vibe of your time together. For example, it is difficult to be in one room for multiple days. Some questions to ask yourself are... does the room have windows? Are there different places to have discussions and breakouts if you want to do larger group discussions vs. paired discussions? Are you eating in the room as well? Can everyone easily see the whiteboard space or space you'll be working from? Can the room accommodate any special needs your group has?

### Location
The location of an offsite is a critical detail and probably one of the most difficult decisions. When looking at a distributed team, it may be attractive to hold an offsite where the most people are located, but if you have flexibility it's worthwhile to think about travel hardships, are some team members always traveling and others never traveling, and what sort of environment do you want to have? Taking everyone out of their day-to-day is often helpful for focused, multi-day offsites. If the goal of your offsite is focused around executing work and hacking, you may want to hold your offsite somewhere closer to nature where the surrounding area isn't as distracting but offers quality areas to walk around in order to enable walking brainstorms around problem solving. Or, if it isn't too distracting, you may decide to utilize your office space for a gathering (although this is my least recommended option). Finally, think about the location in terms of team member preparation. To use a US-based example, if most of your team is located in southern Florida, you may not want to hold an offsite in the middle of Minnesota in January because it's possible most of your team will not have the adequate "gear" required to make it a pleasant experience.

When choosing a location, think of yourself and your team there. Your surroundings can have a large impact on not just physically, but also mentally bringing your team to another space.

### Accommodations
I know, I know, AirBnB or VRBO-type sites can be attractive for gatherings. They're cheaper, you can save on rooming as well as meal costs by buying groceries and cooking, it seems very attractive. And this is a great option for _some teams_ and _some situations_ but there is A LOT to consider before going down this route.

First, do all the rooms have separate bathrooms, separate bedrooms, and locks on the doors.
Second, is the space accessible? Third, if you're planning on cooking meals, how will you ensure that this job does not fall to teh udnerrepresnted minorities in the group, especially the women who often end up bearing the brunt of cooking or cleaning tasks when this sort of arrangement is in the plan. Third, is the space accessible for any  accessibility concerns or needs you may have? Fourth, are there any serious allergies among the group to be aware of?

If you can answer all of these questions, than an AirBnb may be a fine direction to go in for an offsite, but if not, a hotel room block is the way to go.

You may read over this list and think, well, this really only affects one person so we'll get an AirBnB for everyone and then this one person will stay at a hotel which will be a better situation for them. My question to you is, will it be a better situation for them? Having a single individual stay at a different location primarily because of their "sinigleness" in any specific category has the high likelihood of making that individual feel alienated or like they are not _really_ a part of the team. On the same note, if there is one person that you think may not feel comfortable with something, do not ask them. In all likelihood they will either will away their concerns or say they have no problem staying elsewhere simply because they don't want to cause a problem or throw a wrench in to the planning of an offsite. Do not put people in this situation. Be proactive and make sure that appropriate accommodations are secured.
