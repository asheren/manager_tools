# Different types of offsites

## Leadership offsites
Leadership offsites take place with a leadership team of peers together. For example, peer managers in the same department or managers who manage managers in the same segment of the company. Leadership offsites often focus on achieving alignment of multiple teams, working together to determine larger values or a vision that can be transmitted throughout the organization, or solving larger problems that move beyond just a single team.

## Team offsites (with ICs)
These are, I think, the most common type of offsite. Team offsites are when a team of ICs gather to bond, have in-person focused conversation, make decisions, and solve problems. Team offsites can cover a wide swath of ground and have a variety of goals.

## Hack Time offsites
For remote teams, some of the most effective offsites focus on hack time or technical planning. These are offsites where teams generally need to be in the same room, in front of a whiteboard or working together to spike on solutions, brainstorm ideas, and generally solve hard problems. Technically-focused offsites will often involve less of a formal agenda and more on what big questions need to be answered or determined by the end of the time together.

## Planning offsites
Planning offsites focus on, you guessed it, planning. These offsites can be a team of engineers, but generally also include cross-functional team members. They may focus on quarterly plans, half-year plans, or annual plans. They may also include members from other teams where there are dependencies or where roadmaps need to align.

These different types of offsites aren't mutually exclusive. You may have a planning offsite that takes place with a team of ICs, or a leadership offsite that has significant portions of hack time to make progress on a variety of initiatives. Your goals will help inform which offsite you're conducting or what aspects you are incorporating in to your offsite.
