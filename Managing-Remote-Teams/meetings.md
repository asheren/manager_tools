# All About Meetings

Meetings. Meetings. Meetings. Most of my life as a manager is meetings. Short meetings, long meetings, important meetings, meetings that should have been emails, and more. Meetings are so important that I'm dedicating complete sections to some meetings. For example, 1:1s will be it's own section entirely, as will more details about different types of meetings and how to facilitate each. This subject is about meetings as a whole when managing remotely.

Meetings that don't have a purpose suck but when you're working remotely, oftentimes in order to get everyone on the same page or discuss something, you have to set up a meeting as opposed to it happening organically due to everyone being in an office together. That does not mean these meetings should be recurring or should be kept on the calendar forever. In these scenarios, it's important to help folks recognize why information is being asked and what it will be used for, otherwise I've found that anything related to reporting out or weighing in on an idea often falls to the bottom of a to do list. And even then, even if you set a timeline for when the information is needed by and what's it's used for, it sometimes doesn't happen. There are a multitude of ways to get this information (See: asynchronous communication best practices and methods) but when async or the structures in place aren't working, recognize when important conversations or discussions are being missed and don't be afraid to set that meeting.

### Types of Meetings 

When you are remote there are a number of different kinds of meetings.
- Retrospectives - a meeting where you look back and look forward to iterate and improve upon a working relationship either within one team or amongst a number of teams
- Planning meeting - a meeting to look at what's coming up soon and how that work should be broken down, prioritized, tracked, etc. to get everyone on the same page related to milestones and progress markers.
- Pre-mortem - a chance for folks to express their worries, fears, concerns, and excitement usually around a larger undertaking coming up and pre-emptively work to address some of those pain points.
- Post mortem - similar to a retrospective but frequently with a slightly different methodology focusing on trying to dig towards fewer, more specific root causes and related action items
- Team hang/watercooler - chill time with your team for non-work chit-chat
- Virtual offsite - Multi-day gathering potentially covering a wide variety of topics and goals. See offsites.
- Focused brainstorm meeting - A longer meeting (1.5-3 hours, in my experience) focusing on collecting a variety of ideas and frequently driving towards creating strategic alignment for the future. Popular methodologies come from places like the Luma Institute or other interactive facilitation sources.
- 1:1 meeting - regular time for an individual and their manager to connect.
- Skip level - regular time for an individual to connect with the manager of their manager
- Sync meeting - A chance for everyone to get on the same page. This often happens at a regular cadence (ie- weekly or every other week) but may also happen ad hoc
- Quarterly planning meeting - Similar to a regular planning meeting but focusing on a longer timeframe, looking at and planning for initiatives, epics, and other work planned for an upcoming quarter. This may also happen for an upcoming half depending on your company's planning preferences and anticipated roadmap iterations.
- Performance review meeting - A dedicated time to talk more deeply about an individuals performance and provide feedback. Often some level of feedback and performance check-in is happening during 1:1s but performance review meetings usually have a bit more formality and are a dedicated time to dive specifically into performance related strengths and areas of growth.
- All-hands - regular larger meetings, usually larger than one team (a meeting with a team may be a regular sync or planning meeting). This may be a full department or all-company. The format differs wildly based on the engineering leader planning it and goals of all-hands meetings.

### Meeting Cadence
When should you have meetings? and how often?

Meetings should have a purpose and therefore how often meetings should take place depend on the size of the team, working dynamic of the people, and where a team is on a project. Some teams can plan once a month while others need a planning meeting once a week. Some teams can do a retrospective once a month where others find it more beneficial to do one every other week.

Generally, having a team hang and 1:1s weekly is helpful so that folks are talking frequently, but other meetings are up to the individuals. Here's how often I do meetings:
Once per week:
- team hang
- 1:1s

Every other week:
- sync meetings
- planning meeting

Monthly:
- retrospective
- all-hands company wide

Quarterly:
- performance review meeting
- all-hands (department-wide)
- Skip level (although I do skip levels more frequently when i'm first getting to know a team or based on how many folks there are for 1:1s and skip levels)

Bi-annually:
- Virtual offsite 

As needed:
- Pre-mortem
- Post-mortem
- focused brainstorm
