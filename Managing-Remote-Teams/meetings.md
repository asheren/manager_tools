# All About Meetings

Meetings. Meetings. Meetings. Most of my life as a manager is meetings. Short meetings, long meetings, important meetings, meetings that should have been emails, and more. Meetings are so important that i'm dedicating complete sections to some meetings. For example, 1:1s will be it's own section entirely, as will more details about different types of meetings and how to facilitate each. This subject is about meetings as a whole when managing remotely.

Meetings that don't have a purpose suck but when you're working remotely, oftentimes in order to get everyone on the same page or discuss something, you have to set up a meeting as opposed to it happening organically due to everyone being in an office together.

### Meeting Cadence
When should you have meetings? and how often?

Meetings should have a purpose and therefore how often meetings should take place depend on the size of the team, working dynamic of the people, and where a team is on a project. Some teams can plan once a month while others need a planning meeting once a week. Some teams can do a retrospective once a month where others find it more beneficial to do one every other week.

Generally, having a team hang and 1:1s weekly is helpful so that folks are talking frequently, but other meetings are up to the individuals. Here's how often I do meetings:
Once per week:
- team hang
- 1:1s

Every other week:
- sync meetings
- planning meeting

Monthly:
- retrospective
- all-hands company wide

Quarterly:
- performance review meeting
- all-hands (department-wide)

Bi-annually:
- Virtual offsite 

As needed:
- Pre-mortem
- Post-mortem
- focused brainstorm
