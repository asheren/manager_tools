Managing remotely is different than managing in person. I go back-and-forth about whether I could classify it as more difficult or simply different. There are definitely trade-offs, but you can still be an excellent manager remotely. In this way, being a remote manager is no different than being in-person. You want to support these individuals, you want them to be learning and growing, and you want to manage the engineering aspect of products and problems effectively.

- benefits:
  - can keep notes mid-thought process and don't need ot worry about folks seeing partial information
  - can schedule 1:1s and can have reactions between meetings in private
  - can pick up on more of a person... where do they work from? do they move around? etc.

- difficulties:
  - body language
  - ability to follow up or see hwo someone is doing later in the day
  - not sure if you're messaging someone in their heads down time or if they're ok staying in heads down mode when you ping
  - so many meetings... this is true regardless but so many video meetings is a special difficulty... unable to move around or change rooms. harder (but not impossible!) to do a walking meeting, etc.

general tips:
- communicate clearly about you, your working style, and your communication style and recognize how that jives or is different than your team's.
- keep a cheat sheet doc on folks... what are their likes and dislikes outside of work? what's their home life like? Names of kids or partners if they'll share.
